I am part of the Bachelor’s of Science program (BSc) and the reports will be written in English. I will be using python in this project, and python is the only language I feel proficient enough in for peer reviewing other projects in. 

The core of this project is Artificial Intelligence, more specifically, computer vision. I want to implement the Viola–Jones object detection framework for identifying the presence and location of faces in images, and the Eigenfaces method (based on PCA) for recognizing which individual a detected face belongs to in this project. 

 The algorithms to be used in this project are: Integral image construction (data structure is 2D integral image or summed area table), Haar-like feature computation, AdaBoost classifier, cascade of classifiers, and Eigenfaces/PCA. The data structures to be used in this project are: 2D array for greyscale images, feature descriptor list (array of Haar-feature definitions), cascade stage structure (array of stages for AdaBoost classifier), 2D arrays of training data, 2D arrays for eigenfaces matrix, 2D arrays of weight vectors (gallery index). 

Inputs for the Viola Jones algorithm will be a dataset containing face and non face images, they will be used to detect Haar-like features and train the AdaBoost weak learners and cascade stages. Inputs for facial recognition using eigen faces will be a labeled dataset of face images, and will be used to compute mean face, covariance, eigenvectors, and the dataset’s weight vectors. 

The time complexity of the Viola Jones algorithm should take into account the 4 main stages of the algorithm: Haar feature selection, creating integral image, AdaBoost training, and cascading classifiers. The Haar feature selection is O(1) time complexity since it doesn’t depend on the input image. The Integral image creation is O(N) time complexity (N is the number of pixels in the image) since it requires passing fully over the image once. The time complexity of the AdaBoost training is O(N D^2) where D is the number of features, since trivially it is O(N f) where f is the runtime of the weak learner. For a normal style decision tree it would be O(N D^2). The time complexity of the cascading classifiers is said to be less than O(N), since during early stages there are high rejection rates and a lot of the windows are exited early (hence less than worst case O(N)). For eigenfaces the time complexity is just the mean face n times number of eigenvectors k = O(n*k). Comparison to a gallery of weight vectors (where there are G of them) is a naive linear search so the time complexity of that is O(G*k).
