This week I researched and explored which topics most interested me. I landed upon the facial recognition task and decided to use the Viola Jones algorithm to recognize if the image has a face and then eigenfaces to recognize who the face belongs to. I also wrote the specification document which required me to research and learn about the specific algorithms and data structures used in each step of my project, as well as find and understand where the time complexities of each step stem from. 

The program has progressed smoothly on schedule. I still find the rules on using python libraries unclear – to what extent am I allowed to use these libraries such as sklearn and open cv2? What would I have to implement on my own from scratch and what am I allowed to use premade libraries for in my project? I am also unsure whether my current plan for the project is too complicated (will I be able to finish on time?) or simple for the scope of this course. 

Next week I will start working on the rough outline and plan the stages of my project. I will also look for and find suitable datasets I can use for the project. And finally if I have time, I will start coding the core functionalities such as the four stages of the Viola Jones algorithm to get me started off with the project.
