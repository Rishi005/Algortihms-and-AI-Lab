This week I had a meeting with Hannu to discuss my (old) topic, after some clarification we decided on a new topic and so now I will be developing a simple neural network. I rewrote my specification document and did some reading on the basics of neural networks and familiarized myself with all the required math for this topic. I also learnt and set up poetry to use for the project (instead of pip), and read up on the way we need to implement testing. The program this week has been a little rushed since I changed my topic mid week and haven't had much time to work on it since then (i had already started working on my old topic before our meeting but had to scrap everything after the change). I feel like I am a bit behind on schedule as I have only barely started with the code. Things are however a lot clearer than before and I currently don’t have any doubts. Next week I will hopefully progress more with the code and writing the tests, and have a somewhat viable working product.
