This week I created a more comprehensive test to check if the backpropagation function properly computes the gradients of the cost function. I did this by comparing it to an analytical gradient calculated for every weight and bias in  the network. I also created a notebook which showcases how the model works on test data, and also shows how to call and use the model. I also wrote up the testing documentation which summarizes what each test does. I am still unsure if I need to implement more tests or if this is enough, and if I do need to implement more I’m not exactly sure what. I have started working on the implementation documentations but have not finished, next I will hopefully finish that. I also fell a bit behind and have not written down the equations I have used clearly in LATEX so hopefully I can do that next week.
