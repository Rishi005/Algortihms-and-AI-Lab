This week I read through the two chapters of the book about neural networks and learnt how backpropagation worked. I implemented a simple neural net with the stuff I learnt and it reached about 95% accuracy on one of the epochs on the MNIST dataset. I also developed unit tests for my code. The program this week had progressed good, I feel I got back on track by spending some extra time on this project this week. Developing or coming up with tests that evaluate if back propagation works as intended has been a bit challenging, I haven’t implemented anything yet for this week’s submission but I’ve been trying to think about it or plan it and I’m not quite sure how I can test it. Next week I’ll probably continue trying to develop more complex tests beyond unittests, as well as create some documentation to make the equations used in my code more clear.
